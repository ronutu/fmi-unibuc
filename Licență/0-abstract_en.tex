Education is essential in a society, and it is important for textbooks to be of the highest quality. Every year, the Ministry of Education organizes tenders to purchase textbooks with an optimal quality-price ratio. In addition to printed versions, the Ministry also advocates for the creation of digital textbooks.

Two of the advantages of digital textbooks are their accessibility from anywhere, as well as the reduction in the volume of books that students carry daily to school.

Intuitext publishing house, with many years of experience in creating textbooks, seeks to optimize its creation process every year. Until now, converting textbooks into digital format has been a time-consuming process requiring significant attention and human resources. This manual process carried a high risk of errors.

This paper describes an automation software that optimizes the conversion of printed textbooks into digital format, ensuring a high similarity percentage. This efficient process indirectly contributes to the profitability of the Intuitext publishing house.
